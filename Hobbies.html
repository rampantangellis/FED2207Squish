    <p style="color:blueviolet"> 
    At the age of 9, his brother came back down from Minnesota. It was at this time that he was introduced to the world of <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en">Magic the Gathering</a>. So from the time he was 9 to now he plays this table top game even though it is virtually. This led to his interest in other table top games such as <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/">Dungeons and Dragons.</a> He still plays these games simply because they require a thought process and an imagination.

The first video game he ever played was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_Kombat_(1992_video_game)">Mortal Kombat</a>. He was immediately enthralled by the excessive violence and gore. He has since started streaming on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rampantangellis88">Twitch</a>. The games he plays are listed below.
