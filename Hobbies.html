    At the age of 9, his brother came back down from Minnesota. It was at this time that he was introduced to the world of <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en">Magic the Gathering</a>. So from the time he was 9 to now he plays this table top game even though it is virtually. This led to his interest in other table top games such as <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/">Dungeons and Dragons.</a> He still plays these games simply because they require a thought process and an imagination.
